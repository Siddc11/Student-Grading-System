								<h3>About Our Logo</h3>
							</header>
							<h4>"Quality Education for all"</h4>
							<p>The logo of NESGI has been created considering the importance of light. It is divine light  lamp in education. Light symbolizes knowledge. Knowledge is the everlasting wealth a    that is capable of removing ignorance just as the light removes darkness. Our logo implies victory of light over darkens; in other words victory of knowledge and wisdom over ignorance. Education is the only power which makes everyone knowledgeable and wise.</p>
							<p>The flame of a lamp always burns upwards and similarly one should acquire such knowledge as to take us towards higher ideals. It’s a tradition to light a lamp first before starting any auspicious events or rituals. Light symbolizes the absence of darkness, grief  unhappiness. Almighty’s divine grace is spread all over the house by lighting the lamps. God’s first and foremost appearance is in the form of Light which we call as ‘Divya Jyotir’ or “Divine Light”. Before starting our daily prayers, we light the Oil lamp by chanting a shloka:
                               <strong>Subham Karoti Kalyanam Arogyam Dhana Sampadah |
                               Shatru Buddhi Vinashaya Deepa Jyotir Namostute ||</strong></p>
                              <p><strong>Quality Policy -</strong>
                               NESGI provides the future achievers/performers the right amount of knowledge skills and attitude for the purpose of business and life in general by creating academic excellence in the field of management and engineering.</p>
